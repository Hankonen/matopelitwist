Game of snake for a school project made with java. 
This was my very first game. Took a lot from this tutorial series on youtube.com by RealTutsGML: https://youtu.be/1gir2R7G9ws
The game is a typical snake game with few minor changes:
  -You can shorten the snake to a single "block" after eating a powerup
  -At the center there's a moving block that kills the snake instantly when hit
